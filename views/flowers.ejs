              <p>
                  The golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence appear in various areas of nature (Scott, and Gulick, 2010, p.37). The Fibonacci sequence, for example, can be found when analysing patterns of seeds on a sunflower (Darvas, 2007, p.112). The individual seeds create spiral arms, curving to the right and the left. The number of spirals to the left, is however not equal to those spiraling to the right. The spiral arms to the left and to the right are always two successive numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (Darvas, 2007, p.112).<br>
                  Seeds in a sunflower follow the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence. The golden angle plays an important role for the creation of this distinct alignment of seeds. The golden angle is approximately 137.5Â° and seeds in the sunflower are arranged according to it (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer, 1990, p.100). This angle is irrational which means that no seed has a neighboring one at the exact same angle from the centre (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer, 1990, p.101). This creates the spirals in the pattern of sunflower seeds.

              <p>The dark foliage sits along the outside of the spiral. That was a bit of luck... I set the trees up as a "frame" with some space between the dark foliage and the tulips and it worked out well.
                A little extra about the three tulips at the bottom... 3 is a magic number whenever you make a grouping. Even numbers seem off-balance and just don't work well. Groups of odd numbers are the best and 3 feels most comfortable.
                When I evaluate my photos, even though the focus and exposure is right on, sometimes one just doesn't click with me. There doesn't seem to be anything really wrong with it.
                ... but this tulip image felt comfortable to me. Look where the 4 tulips fall within the golden spiral. 
                They're all inside and the closest one is alone, right where the spiral begins! See?... it also fits inside the mid-sized golden triangle.
                The long side of the largest golden triangle bisects the group of three tulips and they're snug inside the spiral and the other side of the largest triangle. 
                By the way, I didn't have a conscious checklist on my mind when I took this photo! Once you understand the concepts, they sink into your brain and eventually, your design comes automatically.
